# whack-a-mole

## Introduction

The Whack-a-Mole game is a popular arcade-style game that has been entertaining players for decades. The premise is simple yet fun: moles (or in modern versions, animated
creatures) pop up randomly from holes, and the player needs to hit them with a mallet
or a hammer to score points. When translated into the world of electronics and DIY
projects, this classic game can be recreated using a microcontroller such as the Arduino
Nano.
