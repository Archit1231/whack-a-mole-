# whack-a-mole-
The Whack-a-Mole game is a popular game and this project recreates it using simple electronics and an Arduino Nano. Instead of toy moles popping out of holes this version uses LEDs to represent moles and buttons for the player to "whack" them. It's an interactive  way to learn about digital input/output, timing, and game logic using  programming.
