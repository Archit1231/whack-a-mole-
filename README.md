# whack-a-mole

## Introduction

The Whack-a-Mole game is a popular arcade-style game that has been entertaining players for decades. The premise is simple yet fun: moles (or in modern versions, animated
creatures) pop up randomly from holes, and the player needs to hit them with a mallet
or a hammer to score points. When translated into the world of electronics and DIY
projects, this classic game can be recreated using a microcontroller such as the Arduino
Nano.

##  Component Selection

 **Arduino Nano** - Acts as the brain of the system.
 
 **LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)** - Used to visually represent the ”moles” that pop up.
 
 **Push Buttons** - Each LED has a corresponding push button positioned in front of it.
 
 **16x2 LCD with I2C Module (Optional)** - Displays real-time score and game messages.
 
 **Resistors** - 220–330Ω resistors are used in series with LEDs to prevent overcurrent.
 
 **Breadboard and Jumper Wires** - Used for quick prototyping and connecting all components
 
 **Power Supply** - The Arduino Nano can be powered via USB from a computer or using an externa l5V adapter.
